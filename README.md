This repository is a multi stage project that spanned the course of 6 month in my class "Intro to Software Engineering".

There is no code, as the class is dedicated to the Project Management side of Software Engineering.

The files are labeled chronologically, each was done within a 3 week time period.

Final mockup is at the end and is simply a concept and early prototype.
